# C# vs Javascript
Some notes on the differences between two languages


## Preface

<p>This is primarliy written for my own benefit, to help organise my learning of C# and .NET. </p>

<p>I hope that my learning of C# is aided by comparing it to something I am already familiar with, ie. javascript.</p>
<p>It may well be that those looking to go the other way may find some value in these notes.</p>
It is not meant as an authoritive reference on the subject and should not be treated as such.
On the contrary: this will be full of mistak.es and inaccuracies.
I shall try as much as possible to keep the style light, jargon-free and informative.
The orgainsition and ordering of these notes may appear haphazard.
<p>Nothwithstanding, I hope any one else who has stumbled upon this work manages to glean some insight or knowledge from it.</p>
