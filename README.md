# C# vs Javascript
Some notes on the differences between two languages


## Preface

This is primarliy written for my own benefit, in order to organise my learning of C# and .NET. 
I hope that my learning of C# is aided by comparing it to something I am already familiar with, ie. javascript.
It may well be that those looking to go the other way may find some value in these notes.
It is not meant as an authoritive reference for the subject and should not be treated as such.
For the same reason the orgainsition and ordering of these notes may appear haphazard.
I shall try as much as possible to keep the style light, jargon-free and informative.
